üß© Assignment: Student Marks Analyzer
üéØ Task:

You have an array of student objects.
Each student has a name and an array of marks.
You need to:

Use map() to calculate each student‚Äôs average mark.

Use filter() to find students who scored above 75 on average.

Use template literals to print a message like:

üéì Manoj scored an average of 85. Great job!


Use the spread operator to add a new student without modifying the original array.

Use the rest operator to create a function calculateTotal(...marks) that adds up any number of marks passed.

üß† Starter Code:
const students = [
  { name: "Manoj", marks: [80, 75, 90] },
  { name: "Priya", marks: [60, 70, 65] },
  { name: "Rahul", marks: [88, 92, 79] }
];

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate each student's average using map()

// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Filter students with average > 75

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Print results using template literals

// 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add a new student using spread operator

// 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a function calculateTotal(...marks)

‚úÖ Bonus (if you‚Äôre feeling confident):

Use arrow functions instead of function.

Use forEach() to print each student‚Äôs details in a nice formatted way.
