📝 Debugging Assignment: Age Checker

Here’s the code (it contains a few errors):

function checkAge(age) {
    if age >= 18 {
        return "You are an adult";
    } else if (age < 18);
        return "You are a minor";
}
console.log(checkAge(20)); // Expected: "You are an adult"
console.log(checkAge(15)); // Expected: "You are a minor"
console.log(checkAge(18)); // Expected: "You are an adult"

Your Task
1.Identify all the mistakes in this code.
2. Fix them so it works as expected.
3. Test it with different ages (15, 18, 20, etc.) to make sure it handles boundary cases correctly.

🔑 Hints
- Check syntax for if statements.
- Watch out for extra or missing characters ((), {}, ;).
- Think about boundary conditions (age = 18).
